## SQL里的Consecutive Numbers

这个知识点（？）可能是我的毕生之痛吧。整理一下以后看看也方便。


```
/*
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| num         | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key for this table.
Write an SQL query to find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively
*/
SELECT *
FROM
    Logs l1,
    Logs l2,
    Logs l3
WHERE
    l1.Id = l2.Id - 1
    AND l2.Id = l3.Id - 1
    AND l1.Num = l2.Num
    AND l2.Num = l3.Num
```

/*
table Failed
+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| fail_date    | date    |
+--------------+---------+
fail_date is the primary key for this table.
This table contains the days of failed tasks.

table Succeed
+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| success_date | date    |
+--------------+---------+
success_date is the primary key for this table.
This table contains the days of succeeded tasks.

A system is running one task every day. Every task is independent of the previous tasks. The tasks can fail or succeed.

Write an SQL query to generate a report of period_state for each continuous interval of days in the period from 2019-01-01 to 2019-12-31.

period_state is 'failed' if tasks in this interval failed or 'succeeded' if tasks in this interval succeeded. Interval of days are retrieved as start_date and end_date.

Return the result table ordered by start_date.
*/

SELECT stats AS period_state, MIN(day) AS start_date, MAX(day) AS end_date
FROM (
    SELECT 
        day, 
        RANK() OVER (ORDER BY day) AS overall_ranking, 
        stats, 
        rk, 
        (RANK() OVER (ORDER BY day) - rk) AS inv

log_id is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table contains the ID in a log Table.
Write an SQL query to find the start and end number of continuous ranges in the table Logs.
Return the result table ordered by start_id.
