## 乱七八糟的小知识点

有时候觉得学ds真无语，啥都要知道一点；又要懂编程又要懂spectral theorem的proof。每回准备面试都要把两年前做的project重新挖出来看看有什么忘了的。干脆趁现在把乱七八糟的知识点总结一下

<h2>
    To find the association between X and Y <br /> 
</h2>
```
if X abd Y are both numeric
  to determne the strength of relationship
    if at least one variable is normally distributed
      Person's correlation coefficient
    if none is normally distributed
      Spearman's correlaton coefficient
  to predict one using the other(s)
    simple linear regression or multiple linear regression
if only Y is categorical
  if class(Y)= 2
    simple logistic regression
  if class(Y) >=3
    Y is nominal
      multinomial logistic regression
    Y is ordinal
      ordered logistic regression
```
<h3>
    for comparing the difference between mean, continuous variable and normally distributed <br /> 
</h3>

```
if comparing sample mean to "true population mean"
    &sigma; is known
        z test
    &sigma; is not known
        t test, but when n>= 30, use z test
if comparing mean between 2 samples
    if it is a paired matched sample
        paired t test
    if independent samples
        &sigma; is the same
            two sample t-test
        &sigma; is not the same
            welch t-test
if comparing mean between >= 3 groups
    paired samples
        RBD
    independent
        ANOVA (use MANOVA when more than one vairable is used to calculate the mean)
```
<h4>
    other random test and notes: <br /> 
</h4>
<b> Randomization test</b> : used to compare mean between two groups. Can be used in conjunction with traditional t test <br /> 
<b> Fisher’s Exact Test</b> : Fisher's exact test is a statistical test used to determine if there are nonrandom associations between two categorical variables. <br /> 
<b> Non-parametric bootstrap test</b> : use the existing data <br /> 
<b> Parametric bootstrap test</b> :  assumption is normal distribution, creates "new data" from existing sample mean and variance <br /> 
<b> Checking normality</b> : use histogram or qq plot <br />
